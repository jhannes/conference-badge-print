# Name badge print

A simple web application to generate PDFs for printing name badges for confences and the like.

[Try it out](https://jhannes.github.io/conference-badge-print/)

* Generate badges from XLSX files
* Upload your own badge background image
* Generate PDF-files directly in the browser
* No backend - your personal data is never sent away from the browser

Limitations:

* Only supports the upload file formats that I have been interested in adding code for
* Currently the layout of the badge information is hardcoded. Fork the project to create your own layout (a better solution is needed)

In progress:

* Multiline taglines
